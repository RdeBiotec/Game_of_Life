/*****************************************************
  * OVERVIEW:
  * The present programme is an implementation in C++ and OpenGl of the denominated Game of Life, a cellular automaton designed by the British mathematician John Horton Conway.
  * It is a zero-player game; its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. 
  * One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves or by creating patterns with particular properties. 
  * The universe of the Game of Life is a two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, 
  * alive or dead, or "populated" or "unpopulated". Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, 
  * which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. 
  * At each step in time, the following rules are applied:
		1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
		2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
		3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
		4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

  * This implementation uses OOP, although it is not required, because it is a very interesting feature of C++, along other languages.
  * The user defines initial parameters about the grid (game board) and cells, and then using a graphical interface places the live cells and observes its evolution.
  * 
  * Have fun!

  * NOTES:
  1. Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.03. Headers (mainly GLUT) should be adapted for Windows and MacOS.
  2. Remember to build using "g++ -Wall  -o "%e" "%f"  -std=c++11 -lglut -lGL -lGLU" or equivalent
  3. Global variables are not optimum, but they have to be created to work with them in the GenerateBoard function
  4. The game can be done much more simpler, but I wanted to use some OOP and make it more visual.
  5. Possible future work:
  * 	-This Game of Life is too simple. Create new rules (stem cells, environment, etc.)
  * 	-Add textures, create a more eye-candy interface.
  * 	-Improve mouse-clicking for certain window sizes and ratios
  * 	-Save each cycle on a .txt, with it, create a heatmap and study the evolution of cell number depending on the starting positions.
  * 	-Improve reshaping of the window (glutReshapeFunc). Currently it works mediocrely when the window is maximized.
  * 	-Detect patterns (gliders, blinkers, etc.). I left some ideas in the code.
  * 	-Create GIFs of the system.
  * 	-Create a graphical interactive menu.
  * 	-Give more possibilities related to the grid size.
